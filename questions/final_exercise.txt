Write a function to produce huffman codes for a set of weights.

The following demands must be satisfied:

(1) The function prototype should be like this:   void HuffmanCode(double weights[], int size);

(2) Inside the function, a variable like char **hcodes should be declared, and the space for huffman codes must be allocated dynamically using new[] operation;

(3)When building huffman tree, a minimum heap must be created by repeating the adjustDown() operation;

(4) After outputting all the huffman codes, the dynamically allocated space must be released;
